        <p id="wrap">WARNING: Please be careful when you light our candles! It is best burned if there is a plate of some sort underneath the candle so it can catch the hot wax. Please also be informed that our candles will look different after you light it because of the wax melting, so it's recommended to use only for decoration and it looks at its best when it is not melted. THANK YOU! </p>
