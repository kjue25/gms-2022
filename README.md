* You only need to edit the `index.html` and `style.css` files to create the home page.
* I will regularly update the folders for each individual team so please don't edit anything in those folders.
* The zip file can be downloaded so you can look at the home page of last year's Entre website and see how the photos and links work. The logos are links to the individual company websites, but note that clicking on them will not work for you at your company (which is okay â€“ you just need to be able to look at the home page code).
* All logos are in the `logos/` folder.
