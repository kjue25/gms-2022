        Hello! Welcome to our Website Cloud Nine! 
        Our team members are Carina, Vivi and Livi!
         Our product is Cloud Lights. 
         The key values in our team are communication, 
         problem solving, speaking our ideas, and dividing 
         work evenly. We try really hard to uphold our values 
         while being kind, patient, and flexible with one
         another. To first decide on our product we accepted
        others' ideas, while contributing our own, and we all
        came to an agreement. We were carefull and thorough
        with all pricing and marketing aspects of our company as well.
        We have exceptional displays of our product, 
        and had much interest based on our feedback forms.
         Out of the 78 people who responded to our survey 
         nobody liked our product less than a 3 on a scale
         of 1-5. (5 being love it, and 1 being don't like it)
         Our product does not take that much time to make and still
         looks high quality! 
         Remember every cloud has a silver lining:)
