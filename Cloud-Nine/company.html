        Hello! Welcome to our Cloud Nine website! Our team members are Carina, Livi, Vivi, and Melany! Our product is Cloud Lights.
<br>
<br>
The key values of our team are communication, problem solving, speaking our ideas, and dividing work evenly. We try really hard to uphold our values while being kind, patient, and flexible with one another. To first decide on our product, we accepted others' ideas, while contributing our own, and we all came to an agreement.
<br>
<br>
We were careful and thorough with all pricing and marketing aspects of our company as well. We have exceptional displays of our product and had much interest based on our feedback forms. Out of the 78 people who responded to our survey, everyone liked our product at 3 or greater on a scale of 1-5(with 5 meaning “love it,” and 1 meaning “don't like it”).
<br>
<br>
Our product is high quality and is a great addition to any space! Remember every cloud has a silver lining:)
