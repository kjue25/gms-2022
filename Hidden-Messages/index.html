    <h1 id="title1">About morse code beaded bracelet</h1>
    <p>You might look at our product and think what is this? Well, our product is called Morse Code Bracelet and they have
        secret meanings like love, happy, and more. These Morse Code Beaded Bracelets are simple yet colorful and go
        with every outfit! We chose to do these because we love bracelets but we wanted something unqiue and these were the
        perfect answer! Each of the meanings will have a different color. For example, love will be pink!
