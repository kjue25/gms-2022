    <h2>Q: How much do the wraps cost?</h2>
    <h3 id="FAQS">A: We are selling all small packs for $15 each and $20 for all big packs. Our special Picnic pack will be sold for $25</h3>
    <h2>Q: How do you clean them?</h2>
    <h3 id="FAQS">A: Our wraps can be easily cleaned with cold to warm water (hot water might melt the wax) and a washcloth. You just need to wipe them down and then they are ready to use again!</h3>
    <h2>Q: Are they food safe?</h2>
    <h3 id="FAQS">A: Yes. All of the ingredients are edible (though we donâ€™t recommend eating them) and your food is safe! However you cannot wash them with boiling water, so do not use them on raw meat.</h3>
    <h2>Q: What are in them?</h2>
    <h3 id="FAQS">A: Beeswax, jojoba oil, and pine resin.</h3>
    <h2>Q: Do they have a smell?</h2>
    <h3 id="FAQS">A: They do not have a particularly strong scent, but they do smell a little bit like honey (because of the beeswax) </h3>
    <h2>Q: Are the bags sealable?</h2>
    <h3 id="FAQS">A: Yes, they keep a pretty strong seal so your food won't fall out. However don't carry liquids in them (for obvious reasons)</h3>
    <h2>Q: Do they stick to bowls well?</h2>
    <h3 id="FAQS">A: Yes, you can lift a corner to check in a bowl without the whole thing coming off. </h3>
